In this Master degree you’ll develop your skills in prescribing exercise to individuals with complex and chronic conditions while developing your research skills. In your first year of study you’ll learn through coursework, as well as undertaking an internship within Murdoch’s Exercise Science Research program. The course culminates in a research project, in which you’ll address a current issue in exercise science. This issue may range from needing to improve sports performance in elite athletes, to personalising an exercise program aimed at improving health in individuals living with chronic conditions or diseases. This course will benefit graduates of sports and exercise programs looking to develop both clinical and research skills, or those hoping to proceed to higher degrees but lacking in the conventional background. 5 reasons to study a Master of Exercise Science (Research) at Murdoch Develop your skills Build essential skills and knowledge to meet your career or study goals. Topics you’ll cover include: Your career Pursue a variety of roles in both public and private health care environments, sports academies, institutes of sports, sports science labs and professional and amateur sporting clubs. You could also work in a range of industries including the private sector, universities, and government institutions. Careers could include: You can also use this course as a pathway to undertake a Doctor of Physiology.
