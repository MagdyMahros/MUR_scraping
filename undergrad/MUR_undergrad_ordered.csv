Western Australia’s only Veterinary Science course will provide you with the opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills and practical experience necessary to solve the existing and emerging problems of our companion animals, livestock and wildlife. A science-based approach and hands-on experience will prepare you for the highest standard of work in the veterinary industry. To become a qualified veterinarian, you will need to complete a three-year, 6 semester Bachelor of Science (Veterinary Biology) that progresses into an integrated two-year, 6 trimester DVM (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine).  You are therefore able to complete your full qualification over 5 calendar years. Students with prior university study in a relevant discipline may be eligible for advanced standing for first year units, with an opportunity for an accelerated option to complete an additional mandatory first year unit over summer. These students can be considered for entry into the second year of the veterinary course, thereby completing the degree over 4 calendar years. Build the knowledge and skills you need to meet your career or study goals. Here are some of the things you’ll learn: When you graduate you will be prepared for a career in animal health related fields, with animals of all species and sizes.  You could work in primary care or emergency hospitals, in small animal practice, in large animal or mixed practice, or as a government veterinarian.  Careers could include: You could undertake specialist training in a wide range of clinical disciplines such as surgery, medicine, pathology, reproduction, or dermatology. On graduation, you will be qualified to register immediately and practise as a veterinarian in Australia and other countries, including New Zealand, the UK, Singapore, Malaysia and North America.
